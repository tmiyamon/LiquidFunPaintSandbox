# LiquidFunPaintSandbox

A reconstruction of [LiquidFunPaint](https://github.com/google/liquidfunpaint) to build in Android Studio in order to learn how liquid fun works.

## Getting Started

You need to set android-sdk and android-ndk path in local.properties like the following.

```
sdk.dir=/usr/local/Cellar/android-sdk/24.4.1
ndk.dir=/usr/local/Cellar/android-ndk/r10e
```

Then you can build it as the same to general Android Studio projects.

## LiquidFun

This project contains the generated stuffs of LiquidFun at commit [0708ce1](https://github.com/google/liquidfun/commit/0708ce1464b0db3cf34353258ce939a82f28a173).
